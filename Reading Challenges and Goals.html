    <h2>2021 READING CHALLENGES and GOALS</h2>
    <p> This year I started out with what I thought was pretty simple goals. But, if you  know me than you know that my reading habits and focus changed midway through the year. 
    So I decided to alter those goals in June to just 3 goals. 
    (List)
    1. Read 50 E-Arcs 
    2. Read 50 Unread Books from my physical TBR 
    3. Complete 15 series 
</p>
    <p>There are also 3 Reading Challenges that I am participating in, all of them can be found on The Storygraph.
