    <p>Hi! Thank you for stopping by my website, whether you are a fellow lover of words or a publisher/author looking for someone who mayu be interested in reviewing your book. 
    I am a mom of twoo litte monsters who keep me on my toes. I can't say that I love all of the challenges of parenting. But one of the things that I do enjoy is sharing my love of reading 
    with my kiddos. They are young, one is just beginning the steps of learning to read, and the other is learning their letters. But give them a book, and they both know what it is and what
    to do with it. They know what my kindle looks like, as well as my Ipad. That should tell you that I read in multiple formats. 
    </p>
    <p>As far as Reviewing goes- I have been an active book reviewer for ten years. 
        When I started my first blog it was a review site for all of the books that I read. Which means that it was pretty much all over the place because I read everything. 
        Now, I still read acrosss all genres, but I have limited my reviewing to just science fiction and fantasy, specifically SFF written by women. That is the majoroty of what you 
        will find on this site. Of course, there are exceptions. 
    </p>
    <p>While I do not have a formal review policy, I have a reviewing process. At one time, I was really good at reading by release date. But, today, 
        with so many distractions I have turned into more of a mood reader. I am also working to clear my backlog of review books. If you would like your book to receive 
        priority attention, the best thing is to contact me via email, or the contact form below. The sooner that you get me a copy of your book, print preferrably, the more likely it is that 
        your book will be reviewed ahead of schedule. Depending on my reading load. 
        I will not accept books that are part of a series, unless it is a series I have already read from or the entire series is provided. unless it is easily accessible. 
        Unless otherwise noted, all reviews are based on my reading the entire book. I do post negative reviews, as well as DNF reviews. I do include disc;laimers about the amount of books that was read 
        and any factors that may have affected my enjoyment of the book.
