    <b>Results:</b>
<ol>
 <li><b>Beasts and Beauty: Dangerous Tales by Soman Chainani</b> – I did read it, and enjoyed it. A full review will be posted on my instagram. </li> 

<li><b>Second Rebel by Linden A. Lewis</b>– Well, technically I didn’t pick up this one. But, according to my rules, this is a stand in for the series.
   So I picked up The First Sister. And I was enjoying it, but I put it down and will finish it. There was a lot going on and it wasn’t moving as 
   quickly as I had hoped. I decided to put it down and come back to it.</li>

<li><b>Nomad by William Alexander</b>- This is a middle grade science fiction space opera that deals with alien, immigration and family. This completes 
  the duology and I have to admit that I am sorry that it took me so long to finally pick it up. I really like Gabe as a character. He never tried 
  to be the hero, he never asked to be an ambassador. But he always tried to do the right thing. I will definitely be reading more of Alexander’s
   books. I also recommend these books for people who are looking to have discussions about immigration, legal and illegal status and what that
    means for families and the world at large. </li>

<li><b>Assassin’s Orbit by John Appel</b>- Well this was probably the most disappointing read of the month. And while I do plan on returning to it, I have
 set it aside for now. I bout this one because it was comped to Golden Girls in space. And unless it was just a reference to the age of the 
 characters (which I appreciate) I can’t say that I was getting Golden Girls vibes from it. It was interesting, and I know that once I go 
 back it, I will enjoy it. A murder mystery in space is definitely in my wheel house.</li>

<Li><b>The Gatekeeper’s Staff by Antoine Bandele</b> – Again, you can find the full review of this on my instagram account.This is a YA Fantasy by 
an author that I keep hearing good things about and I’m glad and grateful that I finally picked up this ARC. I did enjoy it, but it wasn’t 
perfect. I have questions, but I will definitely read more from this author.</Li>
