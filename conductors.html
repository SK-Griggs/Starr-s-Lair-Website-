    <h1>Starr's Book Lair</h1>
    <p>"Sleeping on a dragon's hoard with greedy, dragonish thoughts in his heart, he had become a dragon himself."
        ― C.S. Lewis, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

    <p>This is a bit of historical, fantasy and mystery put together in ways that compliment each other. It’s much more
         about the characters than the actual mystery – though I was invested in how that was resolved. It wasn’t what 
         I was expecting, but that adds strength to the book. As for the mystery itself, you are given a bunch of nuggets 
         and theories that are clouded by the perspective and biases of the investigators – mainly Hetty. You can’t trust 
         what you’re seeing, and you have no idea what is important from what you are seeing. This is not a mystery that 
         is easily solved early on in the book, and that gives you room to really get to know the characters, and see they
          are more to each other than they may believe.  I enjoyed the magic system and learning about it. It was combined 
          with the unknown and constellations making it completely unique and fitting for the characters and the time of 
          the story. I enjoyed this, the side characters were just as intriguing and engaging as the main characters. Glover 
          did an exceptional job of bringing this community to life.  To be transparent, I am not a huge fan of slave 
          narratives, or books that focus on black trauma. I am interested if it is done well and respectfully. I was 
          intrigued about what approach Glover would take in this story. While there are flashbacks of what they went through 
          as conductor, the focus was less on the past and more on how they got to where they were at in the present time. 
          The focus was less on the white authorities that were not interested and completely on Hetty and Benji who were 
          doing what they could for their community. The white community was not ignored, there were important conversations 
          and discussions that were had. But the white community was in the background and only relevant to what specific
        situations. Glover has written a book where the white gaze is not present, and that makes this book even more special. 
        I am definitely looking forward to the next book, The Undertakers, due out November 9th!
