    <p>Hi! Thank you for stopping by my website, whether you are a fellow lover of words or a publisher/author looking for prommotions 
      and reviews of your work. 
    I am a mom of twoo litte monsters who keep me on my toes. I can't say that I love all of the challenges of parenting. 
    But one of the things that I do enjoy is sharing the love of reading with my kiddos. 
    </p>
    <p>As far as Reviewing goes- I have been an active book reviewer for ten years. 
        When I started my first blog it was a review site for all of the books that I read. Which means that it was pretty much 
        all over the place because I read everything. Now, I still read acrosss all genres, but I have limited my reviewing to 
        just science fiction and fantasy, specifically SFF written by women. That is the majoroty of what you 
        will find on this site. Of course, there are exceptions. 
    </p>
    <p> I do not have a formal review policy, as I have turned into more of a mood reader than ever before. The best suggestion that I have 
      would be to contact me directly about any book that you would like reviewed or promoted. 
      <br>
      <button onclick="myFunction()"><u>Things to keep in mind</u></button>
     
      <div id="policy">
      <ul>
      <li>My name is Starr. If you send me a generic email/request without addressing me by name, there's a pretty good chance that I will ignore it.</li>
         <li>I have a backlog of books that I am working through. While I try to get reviews posted in a timely fashion. Please keep that in mind if you 
          are seeking an immediate review. </li>
         <li> I post both positive and negative reviews, on my blog and crossposted reviews. The only reviews that I do not cross post would be DNF reviews.</li>
        <li>Reviewing is a hobby. So sometimes life happens and I have to be an adult. If I miss a deadline, I am sorry, know that if you  haven't given me
          a hard deadline than I will post the review accordingly. Meaning it may get pushed back.</li> 
          <li>It is unlikely that I will accept a book for review that has a hard deadline.</li>
       <li> Please keep in mind that the genres that are reviewed on this blog is specifically SFF/Speculative fiction.</li> 
         <li>I am a fan of series. But I am not a fan of reading series out of order. PLease disclose if the book is part of a series and if it should or shouldnot 
          be read as a standalone.</li> 
            <li>If it is a series that needs to be read in order, you can supply all of the books, or wait until I am able to get the books on my own. But, please keep that 
              in mind when asking for the review to be posted in a certain time frame. I very rarely binge series.</li>
              <li> If you are still interested in me reviewing your book, please <a href = "mailto: theliteratipress@gmail.com">Send Email</a>
              </li>
    </ul>
     </div>
     
    
    
      Again, thank you for stopping by. And I hope that we can connect over books and reviews. If you are just another reader and have books that you think I would
      definitely enjoy, please shoot me the recommendation. It may take me a while, but I promise I will eventually check it out.
