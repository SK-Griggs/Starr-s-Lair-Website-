<h2>The Hoard</h2>
</p> Things I Would like to do:
A carousel of Book covers. When Someone clicks on the image it takes them to the review. 
The Review will have links to The Storygraph for a full summary and buy links to Amazon, Barnes and Noble, 
and Books a Million. 
Carousel will consist of the 3 most recent reviews: Rebelwing, Squad and Generation Manifestation
