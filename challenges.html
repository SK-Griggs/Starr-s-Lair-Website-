    <p>"Sleeping on a dragon's hoard with greedy, dragonish thoughts in his heart, he had become a dragon himself."

    <h2>2023 Reading Goals</h2>
    <p> Every year I have lofty goals that I tend to forget about as soon as the latest shiny book comes out. This year 
      I decided to keep things as simple as possible. This year my goal is simply to read down my TBR. I'll share the numbers
      I'm starting with, and then make quarterly updates. </p>

   <ol>
    <li>Personal E-Books - 1075</li>
    <li>Audiobooks - 37</li>
    <li>2023 E-ARCs - 60</li>
    <li>2023 Physical ARCs - 9</li>
    <li>Older E-ARCs - 670</li>
    <li>Older Physical ARCs - 190</li>
    <li>Physical TBR - 535</li>
    <li>Books Read - 29</li>
    <li>Books Unhauled - 5</li>   
</ol>

   <p>I am hosting and participating in 1 reading challenge this year. But I also have a special project going on. </p>
      <ul class="ch">
       <li>From My Bookshelf- there are 36 prompts that I can use to pick books from my own bookshelves to fill. 
        <p2>28% complete. 10 out of 36 prompts have been filled. </p></li>
       <li>Recommendations -here I will be exploring the recommendations given to me by The Storygraph and Tor (and maybe some 
        from my friends) and then reviewing them. I will also note if it was a good recommendation or not. 
        <p2>I have read 2 recommended books and need to get the reviews posted.  </p> </li>
