    <h2>2021 READING CHALLENGES and GOALS</h2>
    <p> This year I started out with what I thought was pretty simple goals. But, if you  know me than you know that my reading habits and focus changed midway through the year. 
    So I decided to alter those goals in June to just 3 goals. 
    My numerical goal is 180 Books. Currently at 178/180</p>
   <ol>
    <li> Read 50 E-Arcs </li>
        36%
    <li>Read 50 Unread Books from my physical TBR</li>
        28%
  <li>Complete 15 series</li>
        47%
</ol>
</div>
<div class="container">
    <p2>There are also 3 Reading Challenges that I am participating in, all of them can be found on The Storygraph.</p>

        <p2>62% complete. I still need 10 more books to complete this challenge.</p></li>

        <p2>80% complete. I have 1 more book to read for this challenge. </p> </li>
       <li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/reading_challenges/c76d43a2-94fa-4870-8e2e-6405ccb4604a">The Storygraph Recommends</a>
        <p2> 33% complete. I need to read 8 more books to complete this challenge. While I was very excited about this challenge at the beginning of the year, 
          this is the one that I struggled the most to complete. It's not because I don't want to read any of the recommendations, I want to read them all. The 
          problem is that I don't own all of the recommendations and I have been trying to not buy as many "random" books this year.
